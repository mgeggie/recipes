  - 0.5 cup + 3 tablespoons butter, softened
  
### Egg wash:
  - 2 large eggs
  - 2 tablespoons water

## Directions:

### Pie Dough:
  - Slice butter sticks into 0.5" thick slices and place in the freezer for 30 minutes to get it good and cold
  - Add flour to sturdy mixing bowl
  - Add frozen butter, quickly blend with a pastry blender or food processor to roughly pea-sized granules
  - Add ice-cold water and white vinegar
  - Continue blending to a consistency of coarse bread crumbs so it can be pressed together between your fingers and just hold together
  - Remove from bowl and press dough together into a ball
  - Wrap in plastic and place in fridge to rest for at least 1h

### Spice Blend:
  - Mix all of the spices together in a small bowl

### Filling:
  - Peel, chop and boil the russet potato in salted water until soft enough to mash
  - Remove the potato from the water, *KEEPING THE POTATO WATER* to add to the filling later
  - Mash the potato and set aside for later
  - In a large skillet pan, on medium heat, melt the butter and add the chopped onion. Cook stirring until onion has turned a golden brown
  - Add crushed garlic, diced celery and spice blend mix. Stir and cook for 1 minute
  - Add ground pork and ground beef along with a cup of the reserved potato water. Blend together until a paste-like consistency is formed
  - Cook over medium heat for approximately 45 minutes until most of the liquid evaporates
  - Mix in the mashed potato until combined.
  - Remove from heat

### Pie Crusts:
  - Preheat oven to 375 F
  - Remove dough from fridge
  - Divide dough into two equal portions for the two pies
  - Divide each of the two dough portions 60/40 for the bottoms and tops
  - For each of the two bottoms use the larger portions of dough, use a rolling pin to roll out the bottoms into a roughly round, 0.5" thick crust, big enough to fit your pie plates
  - Drape dough over rolling pin, transfer to pie plates and spread into pie plate bottoms. Use excess from any areas to patch areas that are short of reaching the plate edges
  - Fill both pie crusts with even amounts of filling
  - Roll out the remaining two batches of dough into roughly round, 0.5" thick crusts to fit the top of your pies.
  - Drape dough over rolling pin to spread across both pie tops
  - Crimp tops to bottoms using your fingers and thumbs
  - Trim excess dough from the edge, leaving a nice thick crust using a knife
  - Cut a vent hole in the centre of the pie

### Egg wash:
  - Beat eggs with water in a small bowl
  - Generously brush egg wash over both pies
